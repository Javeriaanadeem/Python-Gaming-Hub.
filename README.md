# **Gaming Hub** 
## **Overview**

Gaming Hub is a Python-based desktop application that brings together multiple classic games in one platform. Built using Tkinter for the graphical user interface, it provides a simple yet engaging experience for users who want to enjoy different games without switching between applications.

## **Features**

* Car Racing Game (using pygame)

* Snake Game

* Tic-Tac-Toe (2-player mode)

* Word Scramble

* Main Menu for easy navigation between games

## **Technologies Used**

* Python

* Tkinter (for GUI)

* pygame (for Car Racing)

* random (for game logic and shuffling)

* PIL (Pillow) (for image handling)

## **How It Works**

* A main menu is displayed using Tkinter, allowing users to select from the available games.

* Each game is implemented in its own module and launched when selected.

* The use of random enhances unpredictability in games like Word Scramble and Guess-the-Number type logic.

* pygame powers the Car Racing game for smooth graphics and real-time gameplay.

* Pillow (PIL) is used for handling and displaying images in the interface.
