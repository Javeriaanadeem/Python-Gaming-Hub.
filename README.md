# **Gaming Hub** 
## **Overview**

Gaming Hub is a Python-based desktop application that brings together multiple classic games in one platform. Built using Tkinter for the graphical user interface, it provides a simple yet engaging experience for users who want to enjoy different games without switching between applications.

## **Features**

## **Technologies Used**

* Python

* Tkinter (for GUI)

* pygame (for Car Racing)

* random (for game logic and shuffling)

* PIL (Pillow) (for image handling)

## **How It Works**

* A main menu is displayed using Tkinter, allowing users to select from the available games.

* Each game is implemented in its own module and launched when selected.

* The use of random enhances unpredictability in games like Word Scramble and Guess-the-Number type logic.

* pygame powers the Car Racing game for smooth graphics and real-time gameplay.

* Pillow (PIL) is used for handling and displaying images in the interface.

## **Installation**

**Clone this repository:**

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gaming-hub.git

**Install dependencies:**

## **Future Enhancements**

* Add more games to the hub

* Improve graphics and animations

* Add difficulty levels and scoring system
